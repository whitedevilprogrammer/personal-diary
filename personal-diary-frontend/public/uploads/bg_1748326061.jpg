Prompt: A dreamy watercolor painting in soft pastels of lavender, rose, and pearl white, depicting a barely-there, ethereal figure seated amidst a field of gently swaying wildflowers at dawn.  The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a hazy, atmospheric effect.  The style should evoke a sense of gentle mystery and hopeful beginnings.  Focus on a subtle, almost impressionistic rendering;  digital art elements could enhance the soft light and dreamy quality.  Keywords: soft, dreamy, atmospheric, hopeful, ethereal, dawn, wildflowers, pastel, watercolor.
